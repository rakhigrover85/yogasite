          <!--explaining yoga-->
          Yoga embodies a spiritual discipline rooted in a nuanced science,
          dedicated to fostering harmony between the mind and body. It stands as
          both an art and a science of promoting holistic well-being. The term
          'Yoga' originates from the Sanskrit root 'Yuj', signifying 'to join',
          'to yoke', or 'to unite'. According to Yogic texts, the practice of
          Yoga leads to the convergence of individual consciousness with the
          Universal Consciousness, symbolizing a seamless alignment between mind
          and body, as well as between humanity and nature. Contemporary
          scientific perspectives posit that all entities in the cosmos are
          expressions of the same underlying quantum fabric.Those who perceive
          this interconnectedness of existence are described as being in a state
          of Yoga, known as a yogi, having attained a condition of liberation
          referred to as mukti, nirvana, or moksha. Consequently, the essence of
          Yoga is Self-realization, aiming to transcend all forms of suffering
          toward the attainment of 'the state of liberation' (Moksha) or
          'freedom' (Kaivalya). The primary objectives of Yoga practice
          encompass living with freedom across all spheres of life, prioritizing
          health and harmony. Furthermore, "Yoga" encompasses an inner science
          comprising diverse methodologies through which individuals can realize
          this unity and gain mastery over their destiny. Revered as an enduring
          cultural legacy of the Indus Saraswati Valley civilization, dating
          back to 2700 B.C., Yoga has demonstrated its capacity to contribute to
          both the material and spiritual advancement of humanity. Fundamental
          humane values form the cornerstone of Yoga Sadhana, shaping its
          distinct identity.

          Yoga enhances strength, balance, and flexibility. Yoga alleviates back
          pain. Yoga may alleviate symptoms of arthritis. Yoga supports heart
          health. Yoga induces relaxation, facilitating improved sleep. Yoga
          fosters increased energy levels and uplifted moods. Yoga assists in
          stress management. Yoga fosters connection with a nurturing community.
          Yoga encourages enhanced self-care practices. Gentle movements and
          deep breathing enhance blood circulation and prepare muscles by
          generating warmth, whereas maintaining a posture aids in building
          strength.Give it a go: Tree Pose Stand on one foot, with the other
          foot resting against your calf or above the knee (avoid placing it
          directly on the knee) at a right angle. Fix your gaze on a single
          point ahead of you as you strive to maintain balance for one minute.

          Different types of yoga encompass hatha, Iyengar, vinyasa, hot yoga,
          and ashtanga. Opting for a vinyasa class could be ideal for elevating
          your heart rate during an aerobic workout. Conversely, if you seek a
          more meditative experience, consider attending an ashtanga class,
          which emphasizes deliberate, mindful movement.The eight popular styles
          of yoga are Ashtanga yoga, Hatha yoga, Hot yoga, Iyengar yoga,
          Kundalini yoga, Power yoga, Restorative yoga, and Vinyasa
          yoga.Consistent yoga practice has the potential to lower stress levels
          and reduce body-wide inflammation, thereby supporting heart health.
          Yoga can also address various factors associated with heart disease,
          such as hypertension and obesity, by promoting weight management and
          regulating blood pressure.
