### Yoga Website
#### Discover the secret of a happy life with yoga.

Yoga, derived from the Sanskrit word "yuj" meaning 'union' or 'yoke', encompasses a range of physical, mental, and spiritual practices aimed at regulating and quieting the mind. These practices recognize a state of detached awareness, transcending ordinary consciousness and worldly suffering. With roots in ancient India, yoga manifests in diverse forms across Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, and its traditions, both ancient and contemporary, are observed globally.




# CONTENTS
## User Experience
User Experience (UX) refers to how users interact with a website or application and their overall satisfaction with the experience. User Stories are brief descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the user. For a Yoga website, we can outline the following user stories based on different user goals:

### User Stories

First Time Visitor Goals:



As a first-time visitor, I want to know about yoga and enhance my general knowledge about it.

I want the flexibility to access the website from any location and at any time.

I expect the website to adapt seamlessly to the screen size of my device for a comfortable browsing experience. I desire intuitive navigation to easily find any section and other relevant information.

Returning Visitor Goals:

As a returning visitor, I want the add the option to know more about yoga sessions avaialable and sign up if interested or contact if any more information is required. i want to add more infor and content and pictures based on my previous experience with the site.

I anticipate a smooth transition between user and website. Frequent Visitor Goals:

As a frequent visitor, I seek the ability to customize the home page and other pages enhance my knowledge.

I expect to add a register button for sign up page that allows users to show their interest in yoga sessions providing insight into my progress and performance.

These user stories help guide the design and development of the yoga website to meet the needs and expectations of different types of users.

## Design

Here's our logo 

![yogalogo](https://github.com/rakhigrover85/yogasite/assets/166944094/ff1c6f09-210b-4bc7-94b9-a3467427ae76)




# Colour Scheme


As the topic is very relaxing I wanted to keep the colour scheme used on the site very small and neutral and light so that I donâ€™t end up overwhelming users. I have used all basic normal light colours in css.

Hex Code for colours used is below....

#c4c8c9 - back ground color
#8c8189 - header
#000 - text
#a19b9b- button hover
#d3d3d3 - footer

## Typography

i have used fonts arial, sans-sariff and Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma as back up. Font sizes i have chosen small medium and size 10. 


## Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using balsamiq.

## Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

Give users the option to select the course they want.
Look into courses and able to sign up for that course. providing discount on more than one registrations.

Create a back end database to enable me to storeall the information given by user. which would then allow us to see how many people are interested.
Look further into the accessibility for people with colour blindness, perhaps by adding symbols such as a tick or cross next to the answer when they are checked.

## Responsive

All the pages on the website adapt to different screen sizes. Each page includes a link to the home page, and there's a yoga logo image present on every page, both of which redirect users back to the home page.

## Accessibility    

I have taken care of this thing in mind during coading that website should be very easy to use and navigate through. I have used following technilogy:

Using semantic HTML.
Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
Choosing a sans serif font for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.
 haev ensured that the color i use are netural and goes with the topic.

### Manual Testing 

### Goal 1 (First time visitor)
As a first-time visitor, I want to know about yoga and enhance my general knowledge about it. This is Achieved by adding information about yoga in the home page and adding links to videos providing more information about it. 

### Goal 2(website should be responsive)
This is acheived by adding media queries on my css files. 

### Goal3 easy to (navigate) 

My website is very easy to navigate as i have kept in mind to make it eay to navigate for user. Buttons are added to navigate through home page and all other pages.

6. On courses page table information is displayed well and headbar works fine.
7. On contact us page input fields work fine and submit button works fine and thank you wondow is displayed.


Solved Bugs

1. Headbar was not full width. it was bind in a container with a fixed width. solution was to make it full width headbar which was achieved by giving it full with container class.
2. logo image at starting of headbar was not aligned properly. it was done by removing extra margin and padding.
3. because i wanted to develop this website in netural colours. i was struggling with choosing right colours. i was guided by my mentor to keep same colour theme and use right and same colour on every page.
4. footer was moving to middle in thank you page. the problem was solved by giving right height to page in css.
5. videos links were congested on small devices. so to make is user freindly for users videos were stacked on responsive devices. 
6. sign up page input fields stacked on in responsive devices.


Known Bugs

website needs more work done for make it responsive in landscape mode.
